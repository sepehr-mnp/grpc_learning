-as you already understood, i did not give the path that the tutorial gave to the client
i did this to show that what are the things that this client needs to be able to send data
and they are not all things that server needs


!cation! at the last part of tutorial, they made it with a ext.proto that included the package via their github llink so it did'nt show errors. but the generaated files has cycle importing, so i made it import from current directory and fixed it.
